## Project Background

The scene of contract signing is widespread in all walks of life. Contracts interweaves into our business world, promoting the legitimate and stable development of business.
When signing a contract, both parties usually sign, seal, or fingerprint, which aims to provide the court with a proof of the legal identity of both parties and their willingness to sign the contract when a contract dispute arises.

e-signature is a digital upgrade of the contract signing scene in the era of web2.0. It aims to break the contract signing geographical restrictions and enable two or more parties to realize efficient, low-cost, and environmentally friendly contract signing scenarios across regions.

However, while gaining these advantages, the price is that people lose their most unique value:
1. The certificates and private information that can prove your identity will have to be hosted in a private centralized organization.
2. The signed contract will have to be kept in a private centralized institution.
The user's personal information, identity certificates, and contract documents will be "legally" occupied by a third-party central organization, and the user, as the real owner, can only be accessed under the authorization of such a third-party organization.

What's more serious is that as some large enterprises attach importance to privacy protection, they will often rely on the advantages of social resources to force these third-party centralized institutions to privatize the deployment of e-signature services for them. As a result, the counterparties of these large enterprises (employees, suppliers, customers, partners, etc.) have to entrust their private information, identity certificates, and contract documents to such a "fourth party" centralized organization, causing personal Re-dilution of ownership.

The DeSign e-signature platform aims to realize the vision that users' value assets (identity information, digital certificates, contract documents) belong to users based on the web3.0 ecology and the contract signing scenario, on the basis of the traditional advantages of web2.0, such as efficiency, low cost and environmental protection.

## Project Target
DeSign aims to provide customers with decentralized e-signature and contract management services. As a new generation of e-signature technology, on the basis of retaining the traditional advantages of web2.0 in efficiency, low cost and environmental protection, it realizes the vision that users' value assets (identity information, digital certificates, contract documents) belong to users.

## Critical Issues

#### How to prove the person who signed a contract is me?
1. DeSign will automatically generates an e-signature account based on user’s private wallet when user access on DeSign.
2. User needs to activate its account by completing the identity authentication.
3. when User completes his identity authentication, he will acquire a digital certificate issued from Kilt DID and a Signature automatically generated by DeSign based on its certificate name. 
4. Only activiated user can take part in a signing task.

#### How to prove that I am willing (to authenticate or to sign)?
1. During identity authentication, the user is required to take a photo on the spot with the certificate in hand.
2. When initiating a certification application or signing a contract, it is necessary to activate the smart contract and make payment through the personal wallet account as a proof of its will.

#### How to let user establish a general task so as to let multiple people to sign on multipule docs?
1. a SignTask is regarded as an independent and complete process for people to sign, which involves what's the signing topic? who will participate? what docs should be sgined? Where does everyone sign each document separately? Who sign first and who is the second?... Hence, there is needed a initiator to create a signTask to arrange all the above issues.
2. When a SignTask has been created and Initiated, It's inefficient for initiator to manually arrange the signatures of all parties, therefore we need each signtask has a automatically status transferring mechanism to let right person to know when he/she needs to login DeSgin to sign and How to access the Signing Docs.
3. When each SignTask recipient complete signning, the SignTask can be concluded automatically and allow each participant to download the signed docs.
4. all the above operations are free. 

#### How to let user to complete a sign scenero?
1. When a person has been invited to sign through DeSgin, he/she will receive a notice email even if he/she is not a DeSign User.
2. The invited person will be guided to register/login/authentic his own DeSign account and receive the signtask.
3. the recipient can view the docs of received signTask and sign his/her signature on the given position of each doc. 
4. to prove he is willing to sign, a confirmation of will will bee made by paying for the following smart contract, which will automatically completing the signed docs generated and uploaded to DSS, status change of both Signtask and recipient.

## Tasks to be completed during Hackathon

#### Account Generation
1. Account Generation based on Polkadot.js, 
2. Polkadot.js Connection & Authentication,
3. Email binding 
4. Index Page, Home Page
5. Log out

#### Individual Certificate Acquisition
1. VerifyTask Submission & Individual Identity material stored on Dss,
2. VerifyTask payment & authentication,
4. Individual certificate acquisition from Kilt DID.

#### Personal Signing
1. SignTask creation & initiation & processing & conclusion,
2. SignTask invition & receiving & view & Sign & Payment.
3. SignTask Docs Mgt. in Dss.

## Problems to be solved during Hackathon

#### Issues related to certificate application
1. How to safely and reliably store the real name information submitted by users in a decentralized way?
2. After the authentication task submitted by the user is linked, how to audit it through the management background?
3. How to generate DID format digital certificates for users on the Kilt chain based on the real name information submitted by users and approved by the background?

#### Issues related to signing tasks
1. A signing task may contain multiple documents to be signed, and there may be multiple signers. Each person who signs a document will generate a new document. When each document is uploaded to the DSS, costs will be incurred. How to minimize user costs and operating costs while meeting the principle of decentralization?
2. After a signing task is initiated, multiple signers will receive a signing notice. When each signer opens the task and completes signing, it will output the corresponding products (new signature documents, signature Hash and other information). How to organize multiple parties on the blockchain to complete signing once and finally complete the signing task?

1) **signTask Status**: Created, Initiated, Processing, Conclusion, Archived
    1. **Created**: a signTask has been created but hasn’t initiated yet,
    2. **Initiated**: a signTask has been initiated but hasn’t received by any recipient,
    3. **Processing**: a signTask has been initiated and has received by one or multiple of recipients.
    4. **Conclusion**: a signTask has been signed by all of recipients, but unarchived docs exist.
    5. **Archived**: all docs of signTask have been archived.
2) **recipient Status**: Unreceived, Received, Signing, Signed.
    1. **Unreceived**: the recipient has not become a DeSign User,
    2. **Received**: the recipient is the DeSign User but haven’t take a payment for signing,
    3. **Signing**: the recipient has payed for signing, but the execution of related smart contract hasn’t been concluded.
    4. **Signed**: the execution of smart contract for signing has successfully completed.
