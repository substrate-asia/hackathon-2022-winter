<center> Figure 1. VIDEOWN homepage </center>

​		The VIEDOWN homepage consists of a search bar, a video upload button, a wallet account button, and video information. Each video shows the cover, title, account, view count, price, and other related information, which is convenient for users to quickly review videos they are interested in; click on the cover to enter the video playback page, as shown in Figure 2.

![image-20221221170246051](./assets/image-20221221170246051.png)

<center> Figure 2. Video playback page </center>

​		On the right side of the webpage is a list of related videos, below the video are its title, account owners, and description. At the bottom of the page are the addresses of the miners who saved the video fragments. It is showing that video fragments are stored among six miners in the CESS blockchain network. On the lower right corner of the video shows the view count. Click into “View Detail” found next to the video title to get more information, as shown in Figure 3.

<center> Figure 3. Video NFT detailed information </center>

​		Right side of the video window displays the detailed information including the video creator, owner, size, chain information for storage, etc. The file hash at the bottom shows the unique data fingerprint of the video for data ownership protection purposes. The video status shows that the video has been safely uploaded to the storage miners. The NFT status shows that the video NFT is currently being minted (metadata has been generated but not minted). At the bottom of the page, the event list shows all the NFT metadata, under the “To” column of the list is the creator of the video. Since the video NFT is not yet available, no buy button is displayed.

## 2. **System Login**

​		Click **Connect Wallet** on the top right corner of the VIDEOWN homepage, import the Polkadot wallet account, as shown in Figure 4. Before doing that, you have to register a CESS chain account and successfully add it to the Polkadot wallet plug-in. For your convenience, we provide a set of account addresses for users to use.

<center> Figure 11 Personal account homepage </center>

​		This webpage displays the video information collected by the account, including all videos created, purchased, and transferred (gifted) by others. Click the icon in the lower left corner of any video to manage the video, as shown in Figure 12.

![image-20221221170101076](./assets/image-20221221170101076.png)

<center> Figure 12 Video NFT Collected </center>		

​		The video NFT has not been minted, so only the minting operation can be selected. Different operations can be selected during different states of the video NFT. For example, you can list and transfer the NFT after it is minted, and removal operation is available after being listed. Meanwhile, the account balance is sufficient with enough storage space, you can also purchase video NFTs posted by others.

​		Click **Created** on the page shown in Figure 12 to display the video NFT you created, as shown in Figure 13. In this example, most of the video NFTs collected by this account were created by themselves.

![image-20221221181015068](./assets/image-20221221181015068-1672025625140-13.png)

<center> Figure 13 Video NFTs in Created webpage </center>		

​		Click **Listing** to view the listed video NFTs you own, as shown in Figure 14. The account in this example has not listed any video NFT.

![image-20221221181327932](./assets/image-20221221181327932-1672025633732-16-1672025639006-18.png)

<center> Figure 14 Video NFT in listing webpage </center>

​		Click **Activity** to enter the event management interface of the account, as shown in Figure 15. This interface will list all the NFT change records of the account to check their asset status.

![image-20221221181522978](./assets/image-20221221181522978.png)

<center> Figure 15 Video NFT Activity webpage </center>

​		The Item in the Activity list shows the title and covers of each video NFT, the Event column on the left shows the status type. From and To on the right show the transfer info of the video NFTs. Since the event type is “create”, it means that a video NFT metadata has been created. Therefore, From is empty, and To points to the creator of the video NFT metadata. The last column Time indicates the time when the event occurred.

## 3. **Upload Video**

​		Click the **Upload Video** button. While uploading a video, VIDEOWN automatically creates the metadata of the NFT, so this interface is also called "Creating New Video NFT" as shown in Figure 16. However, before uploading, please authorize the use of space in VIDEOWN on the CESS chain and purchase enough space. The available space size is displayed on the right side of the Upload Files module.

![image-20221221183942134](./assets/image-20221221183942134.png)

<center> Figure 16 Video upload webpage </center>

​		Click the **Authorize Storage Space** for space authorization, as shown in Figure 17.

![image-20221221184529072](./assets/image-20221221184529072.png)

<center> Figure 17 Storage space authorization </center>

​		Users will be prompted to enter a password of the account. The password is created after importing the account into the Polkadot wallet. as shown in Figure 18.

<center> Figure 18 Signing the transaction </center>

​		The space authorization will be completed in a few seconds. Now, users can purchase storage space for the account, as shown in Figure 19.

![image-20221221185050458](./assets/image-20221221185050458.png)

<center> Figure 19 Purchase storage space </center>

​		Click **Buy Storage Space** on the right side of the Upload Files module (Figure 19) to purchase space, as shown in Figure 20.

![image-20221221185214543](./assets/image-20221221185214543.png)

<center> Figure 20 Purchase storage space </center>

​		Select the desired storage size and pricing options. Click **Submit** to purchase or **Return** to cancel. For uploading the video. Enter the video file and the corresponding NFT metadata information, as shown in Figure 21. Click **Create** at the bottom to upload the video and create the video NFT metadata.

![create-videonft2](./assets/create-videonft2.png)

<center> Figure 21 Video upload </center>

​		The uploaded video details can be found in the Overview page. VIDEOWN records the entire process of all file uploads to provide complete file traceability. The upload has been completed as shown in the Overview module in Figure 22, and the hash value (data fingerprint) of the video is displayed below. The Detail module on the left side outputs the file upload process in the backend through command lines. The File Storage Details module displays the address of the miner who stored the file. In this example, there are three miners who have stored all the fragments of the video. A video playback window to preview the content is located at the bottom of the page. 

![image-20221221190235922](./assets/image-20221221190235922.png)

<center> Figure 22 uploading details page </center>

​		It is worth noting that the Detail module provides an interactive display of the upload details. First, files are pre-stored in buckets after being sharded, and buckets are object buckets defined by the CESS object storage services. One account can create several object buckets, and use these buckets to implement file management operations. In the CESS object storage service, it is used to randomly and evenly schedule the video fragments to the distributed nodes of the storage miners. The VIDEOWN backend then sends a file storage statement to the CESS chain. After the transmission is successful, the file fragments are sent to the scheduling miners (distributed nodes in the CESS object storage services randomly and evenly schedule video fragments to the storage miners). The three uploading processes show all the storage miners who received the file fragments. Finally, storage miners receive and save the video fragments and complete the video upload process.

## 4. **Minting Video NFT**

​		If you are the creator of a video NFT file, you can mint its NFT. Navigate to the personal account page, click on the video cover to enter the video details interface, as shown in Figure 23.
